# Test_4
# DESCRIPTION:

This test contains the simulated 2nubb data. 
A common *simulated* data-set containing 10k events of `Se82.2nubb` was generated. Two tracking approaches were applied to the simulated data in separate folders. 

# PROCEDURE:

The plan is to:
1. Compare visually (all?) reconstructed events and build a gallery
2. Compare visually, reconstructed events under specific data-cuts
3. Export data into a root file for statistical analysis.
